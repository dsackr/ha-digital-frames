# Digital Frames for Home Assistant

Turn your digital photo frames into a gallery wall that Home Assistant actually controls — no vendor app, no cloud account required for the local drivers. Point it at your frames and start sending photos in minutes.

**Digital Frames** is the product name. The Home Assistant domain and package path remain `fraimic` for install stability (HACS, existing config entries, entity ids). Official Spectra e‑ink panels remain manufacturer **Fraimic** in the device registry.

## Why you'll want this

- **No cloud in the loop (local drivers).** Talk to frames over your own WiFi. No account to create for Fraimic, Meural local, or experimental Samsung MDC.
- **One tap turns a wall into a scene.** Match photos to frames — say, four frames each showing a different shot — and flip the whole wall at once from a dashboard, a voice command, or an automation.
- **Your library, not a photo dump.** Upload once, organize into albums, reuse the same photo across frames and scenes without duplicating files.
- **A gallery wall out of the box.** Install a curated public-domain art pack (Monet, da Vinci, van Gogh, and more) with one click — Home Assistant imports it, matches pieces to your frames by orientation, and builds a ready-to-send scene automatically.
- **Set it and forget it.** Daily agenda mode turns your calendar into a frame display; rotation mode cycles albums. Once configured, it just runs.
- **Multi-vendor.** Fraimic / community e‑ink, Meural Canvas (local), and experimental Samsung EM32DX — one walls/scenes/library core.

## Quick start

1. Install through HACS: add `https://github.com/dsackr/fraimic-homeassistant` as a custom repository (category: Integration), then install **Digital Frames**.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Add Integration**, search **Digital Frames**, and follow the prompts. Wake your frame first so it's discoverable.

That's it — your frame shows up as a device, ready to receive photos. The sidebar panel is labeled **Digital Frames** (URL path stays `/fraimic`).

Manual install, troubleshooting, and full hardware requirements: see [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md).

## Credits

**Meural Canvas local protocol** — endpoint inventory for the on-device
`/remote/` HTTP API (identify, system check, backlight, suspend/resume,
postcard upload, galleries JSON, etc.) was published by **Guy Sie** in
[HA-meural](https://github.com/GuySie/ha-meural) (MIT License,
Copyright © 2020 Guy Sie). Our Meural support is a **local-only** FramePort
driver inspired by that documentation; we do not use Meural cloud/Cognito and
do not vendor HA-meural code. If you want full Meural cloud playlists and
media-player UX in Home Assistant, use HA-meural.

**Samsung EM32DX (experimental)** — MDC content-download packet layout, TLS
PIN auth, and WoL/SSDP workflow are documented in
[fayep/Joyous](https://github.com/fayep/Joyous) (`Samsung/samsung_serve.py`
and hub MDC code). Our driver is an independent HA reimplementation; it has
**not been validated on real Samsung hardware** in this project. InkJoy is
**not** integrated here (vendor control plane is MQTT — deferred).
