# Fraimic for Home Assistant

Local Home Assistant integration for Fraimic e-ink canvas frames. Controls your frames directly over WiFi — no cloud, no account required.

## Features

- **Auto-discovery** — finds Fraimic frames on your local network automatically
- **Sensors** — battery level, WiFi signal strength, firmware version
- **Send any image** — push PNG or JPG files to a frame; images are auto-converted to Spectra 6 format on the fly
- **Controls** — refresh display, put frame to sleep, restart frame
- **Daily agenda mode** — pulls calendar events and renders them as an image for the frame
- **Photo rotation mode** — cycles through albums from Google Photos or iCloud

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Integrations → HACS**
2. Click the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**

## Requirements

## Image Format Note

Images are converted to Spectra 6 raw `.bin` format before being sent to frames. This format is community-validated, but e-ink panels can vary — test with your frame and [open an issue](https://github.com/dsackr/fraimic-homeassistant/issues) if the display looks wrong.
