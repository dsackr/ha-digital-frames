# Key Product Flows

This is the catalog of **Digital Frames** Key Product Flows (KPFs) — the
user-facing capabilities the integration provides, kept current as the
source of truth for what "the product doing its job" means. (HA domain and
package path remain `fraimic`.) Each entry says what breaks for the end
user if the flow silently fails, and where it's tested today.

**Maintenance rule (binding for all contributors, human or AI):** any change
that adds or alters user-facing behavior must land together with (a) a new
or amended KPF entry here — including an updated test-status line — and
(b) the tests that entry claims. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the full
requirement. New KPFs are appended (numbers are stable identifiers referenced
from code and test docstrings — never renumber existing entries).

See [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](../TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for the testing standard
this catalog feeds into, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for how
the codebase is laid out.

Test status legend:
- **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/` exercises the Python logic directly.
- **Panel-tested** — `tests/panel/` exercises the frontend against a mocked
  backend (see `tests/panel/README.md`); the Python side may still be
  untested.
- **Gap** — no automated coverage yet, backend or frontend.

---

## 1. Frame discovery & add-frame wizard
User chooses **Fraimic / e-ink clone** or **Meural Canvas (local)** from the
add-frame menu. Fraimic path scans the LAN or takes an IP and auto-detects
size/resolution; Meural path probes the local postcard API and stores a
`driver=meural` config entry.

**Background auto-discovery** (every ~20 min + on panel open) is **active
HTTP probing** of the HA host's /24 — not a shared broadcast protocol.
Each IP is asked `GET /api/info` (Fraimic family) then, if that fails,
`GET /remote/identify/` (Meural local). Hits feed HA's
`SOURCE_INTEGRATION_DISCOVERY` pipeline: Fraimic → name-device form;
Meural → `discovery_confirm_meural` form. Already-configured frames are
matched (device_key / Meural unique id / host) and IP is updated if the
frame moved; pending flows dedup via `unique_id`.
- **Entry points**: `config_flow.py` (`DigitalFramesConfigFlow.async_step_user` /
  `add_fraimic` / `add_meural` / `discovery_confirm_meural` / `pick_device` /
  `manual` / `name_device` / `dhcp` / `integration_discovery`),
  `helpers.py` (`probe_frame`, `probe_device_size`, `scan_subnet`,
  `detect_frame_type_from_info`), `meural.py` (`probe_meural`,
  `meural_unique_id`), `discovery.py` (`_async_scan_once`,
  `_match_and_update_meural`).
- **If it silently breaks**: users can't add frames at all, or duplicate
  entries get created for the same physical frame; Meurals never appear
  under Settings → Devices & Services → Discovered.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`flow-renderer.spec.js`,
  `frame-manage.spec.js`). **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/config_flow/test_config_flow_user_scan.py` (menu,
  Fraimic user/manual/pick_device/DHCP steps, Meural local add, Meural
  integration_discovery + confirm, size auto-detect, dedup);
  `tests/python/unit/test_meural.py` (`meural_unique_id`, dual-probe
  `scan_subnet`); `tests/python/unit/test_discovery_meural.py`
  (background sweep starts Meural discovery flow / skips configured).

## 2. Options flow (scan interval, size, orientation edge, 180° flip)
User edits a frame's scan interval, physical size, hanging edge, and
180°-rotation flags via HA's Configure dialog.
- **Entry points**: `config_flow.py` (`DigitalFramesOptionsFlow.async_step_init`).
- **If it silently breaks**: settings don't stick, or the orientation lock
  resets when saving an unrelated field.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`flow-renderer.spec.js`). **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/config_flow/test_config_flow_options.py`.

## 3. Coordinator polling & IP self-healing
Each frame is polled periodically for battery/wifi/firmware/dimensions; if
it goes silent for 3 polls, a subnet rescan finds its new IP (a DHCP-moved
frame).
- **Entry points**: `coordinator.py` (`DigitalFramesCoordinator._async_update_data`,
  `_async_try_find_new_host`, `_maybe_persist_fingerprint`).
- **If it silently breaks**: sensors go "unavailable" forever after a router
  reassigns the frame's IP; the user thinks the frame is dead.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/coordinator/test_coordinator_polling.py`,
  `test_coordinator_concurrency.py`.

## 4. Send image now (queue-if-asleep) — the core send primitive
Every "send to frame" path (service, raw upload, library send, scene send,
schedule fire) funnels through one send-or-queue mechanism so a sleeping
frame gets the image on wake instead of losing it or double-sending. Image
upload timeout comes from the panel profile
(`FrameType.send_timeout_s` / `send_timeout_for_entry`) — default 240s so
slow ESP32 sequential panels (7.3") finish their e-ink redraw before the
connection is aborted, preventing spurious delivery failure reports and
double-refreshes.
- **Entry points**: `coordinator.py` (`async_send_image_or_queue`,
  `async_send_image`, `_async_flush_pending_send`, `_set_pending`,
  `_clear_pending_if_current`), `frame_types.send_timeout_for_entry`.
- **If it silently breaks**: images sent to a sleeping frame vanish, or a
  wake causes a duplicate redraw.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/coordinator/test_coordinator_queue_on_sleep.py`. The single
  highest-value target in this catalog per the initial gap analysis.

## 5. HA services (send_image, send_scene, restart, sleep, refresh, generate_ai_image)
Lets automations/scripts drive a frame: send an arbitrary media item, send
a named scene, or issue restart/sleep/refresh commands.
- **Entry points**: `__init__.py` (`_register_services`, `_handle_send_image`,
  `_handle_send_scene`, `_handle_generate_ai_image`, `_resolve_media_path`).
- **If it silently breaks**: automations calling `fraimic.send_image` /
  `send_scene` fail or send the wrong image; a path-traversal bug in media
  resolution could leak files.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/setup/test_services.py`
  (command services, send_image media resolution + path-escape rejection,
  send_scene aggregation semantics).

## 6. Voice/AI: "generate an image of X...", "show [image name] on [frame]", and "put a picture of [tag name] on [frame]"
Custom Assist/LLM intents to generate an AI image, display a specific library image on a named frame, or randomly select and display an image matching a custom tag by voice.
- **Entry points**: `intent.py` (`DigitalFramesGenerateAIImageIntent`,
  `DigitalFramesShowImageIntent`, `_match_frame_device_id`, `_match_by_tag`).
- **If it silently breaks**: the voice command errors out, fails to find the
  image or tags, or resolves to the wrong frame.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/setup/test_intent.py` (covers exact voice name matches and random tag-based selections).

## 7. Image conversion pipeline (Spectra 6 .bin encoding + decoding)
Converts any Pillow-readable image into the frame's proprietary packed-
nibble binary format: auto-rotate, cover-crop, manual crop, canvas
rotation, dithering, and two PanelCodecs (split-half vs. sequential).
Call sites that produce wire payload for a send should use
`panel_codec.encode_for_panel*` (codec selection by panel geometry);
packing primitives remain in `image_converter.py`. Also the reverse
direction: unpacking a `.bin` back into an image, used to build a preview
thumbnail for sends that only ever see packed bytes (the xOTD/skill text
renderer — see KPF 28/29).
- **Entry points**: `panel_codec.py` (`encode_for_panel`,
  `encode_for_panel_with_preview`, `encode_path_for_panel_with_preview`),
  `image_converter.py` (`convert_image*`, `_process`, `_process_cropped`,
  `_pack_to_spectra6_bin` / `_pack_p_image_fast`, `default_cover_crop_box`,
  `unpack_spectra6_bin`, `preview_png_from_bin`).
- **If it silently breaks**: this is the "garbled/duplicated image on the
  physical frame" failure the module's own docstring calls out — no
  exception, just a wrong picture on real hardware. A broken unpacker is
  the softer cousin: wrong/blank card and panel thumbnails after xOTD sends.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/unit/test_image_converter.py`,
  `tests/python/unit/test_panel_codec.py`, including pack→unpack
  byte-exact round-trips against both byte layouts. Flagged as the riskiest
  silent-failure surface in the codebase in the initial gap analysis; also
  has a standalone byte-identity script (`scripts/verify_packing.py`) run
  manually against real photos when touching either packer.

## 8. Shared image library: upload, list, stream original, thumbnail, voice name, tags
Users upload photos into one shared pool; images are listed/streamed for
the panel's grids with on-the-fly cached thumbnails, and can carry user-defined
voice names and tags for Assist commands. Wire-payload (`.bin`) cache keys
include PanelCodec id (`codec_id`) under
`bin/<WxH[variant]>/<codec_id>/` so sequential vs split-half packs never
collide; pre-Phase-2 resolution-only bins still serve as a read fallback.
- **Entry points**: `library.py` (`LibraryManager.async_upload` /
  `list_images` / `get_original` / `get_thumbnail` / `async_get_bin_for_send` /
  `async_set_image_voice_name` / `async_set_image_tags`,
  `LocalLibraryBackend` / Dropbox / Drive `_bin_path` + `bin_file_ids`),
  `library_http.py` (`DigitalFramesLibraryImageVoiceNameView`, `DigitalFramesLibraryImageTagsView`).
- **If it silently breaks**: uploads silently fail per-file in a batch,
  thumbnails go stale/broken, voice name/tag edits fail to persist, or a
  7.3" send reuses 13.3"-layout bytes (wrong codec cache).
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`dashboard.spec.js` covers grid rendering, album navigation, voice name, and tags configuration/clearing; `lazy-thumbs.spec.js`).
  **Backend-tested** (local backend) —
  `tests/python/library/test_library_local_backend.py` (single/multi
  upload, undecodable-bytes tolerance, thumbnail cache generation/reuse,
  delete purges original + thumbnails, voice name and tags updates);
  `tests/python/library/test_library_crop_albums_backfill.py` (codec-keyed
  bin cache + legacy path fallback).

## 9. Library storage backend switching (Local / Dropbox / Google Drive)
User can point the whole library at Dropbox or Google Drive instead of
local disk, with validation before switching and fallback to local on
failure.
- **Entry points**: `library.py` (`LibraryManager.async_set_backend` /
  `async_load`, `DropboxLibraryBackend`, `GoogleDriveLibraryBackend`),
  `library_http.py` (OAuth start/callback/redirect-uri views).
- **If it silently breaks**: switching backends fails and silently reverts
  to local without the user noticing, stranding photos on the wrong
  storage.
- **Test status**: **Gap** — Dropbox/Google Drive backends and their OAuth
  flows are the remaining, highest-effort slice of Phase 5 (heavy
  request/response mocking for token exchange and refresh); not yet done.

## 10. Library discovery (adopt externally-added files)
Dropbox-only: photos dropped directly into the user's Dropbox get adopted
into the manifest and queued for `.bin` generation.
- **Entry points**: `library.py` (`DropboxLibraryBackend.async_discover_new_files`,
  `LibraryManager.async_discover`), `library_http.py`.
- **If it silently breaks**: dropped photos never appear in the panel, or
  get re-discovered forever if inbox removal fails.
- **Test status**: **Gap** — depends on the Dropbox backend above; same
  remaining slice of Phase 5.

## 11. Library `.bin` cache & background backfill
Every image gets a per-resolution `.bin` pre-generated in the background
across all configured frame resolutions/orientations; a send before
backfill finishes still works via on-demand conversion+cache.
- **Entry points**: `library.py` (`_schedule_backfill`,
  `_async_backfill_worker`, `async_get_bin_for_send`).
- **If it silently breaks**: sends are slow, or a send uses stale bytes
  after a crop change if cache invalidation is missed.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/library/test_library_crop_albums_backfill.py` (backfill
  generates bins for configured frame resolutions, on-the-fly generation
  + caching when uncached, cache-hit skips reconversion, `pack_method`
  override bypasses the cache without polluting it).

## 12. Manual crop editing per image/resolution
User can save a manual crop rectangle for one image at one frame
resolution (or fallback per-orientation), invalidating cached renders.
Reachable from three places: the Library shelf's crop editor, the wall
image picker's "✂ Adjust Crop" (hands the staged/on-frame photo to the
same editor pre-targeted at that frame), and the Lovelace card's own
crop editor (KPF 29), whose "Save & Send" persists the crop then
immediately re-sends so the physical frame updates.
- **Entry points**: `library.py` (`async_set_crop`, `async_clear_crop`),
  `library_http.py` (`DigitalFramesLibraryCropView`), `digital-frames-panel.js`
  (`_openEditor`, `_cropFromWallPicker`), `digital-frames-card.js` (`_openCrop`,
  `_cropSaveSend`).
- **If it silently breaks**: a saved crop doesn't apply on next send, or
  clearing a crop leaves stale cached renders for the same orientation.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`walls-crop-button.spec.js` — enable/
  disable rules and the wall-picker → editor handoff with the frame
  pre-targeted; `fraimic-card.spec.js` — the card's full crop flow
  including the save + re-send round trip against the mock server;
  `walls-image-picker.spec.js` covers the surrounding picker UI).
  **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/library/test_library_crop_albums_backfill.py`
  (exact-resolution save invalidates that bin, fallback-orientation save
  invalidates every matching resolution, clear reverts + invalidates,
  unknown image raises).

## 13. Album management (tag, rename, delete, batch-add)
Photos can be tagged into any number of albums; albums are emergent from
tags, with rename/delete affecting every tagged image in one bulk write.
- **Entry points**: `library.py` (`async_list_albums`,
  `async_set_image_albums`, `async_rename_album`, `async_delete_album`),
  `library_http.py`.
- **If it silently breaks**: rename/delete misses images, or the default
  "Images" album gets renamed/deleted, breaking the "always at least one
  album" invariant.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested indirectly (`walls-addon-album-lock.spec.js`).
  **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/library/test_library_crop_albums_backfill.py`
  (create via tagging, rename/delete across multiple images, default-album
  protections, empty-name/empty-selection rejection).

## 14. Send library image to a frame
The panel's "Send to Canvas" — reuses/generates the cached `.bin` for that
frame's resolution and delivers or queues it.
- **Entry points**: `library_http.py` (`DigitalFramesLibrarySendView`),
  `library.py` (`async_get_bin_for_send`), `coordinator.async_send_image_or_queue`.
- **If it silently breaks**: sends the wrong crop/orientation, or the
  packer A/B override leaks into the normal cache.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`packtest.spec.js`, `dashboard.spec.js`).
  The underlying `async_get_bin_for_send` (KPF 11) and
  `async_send_image_or_queue` (KPF 4) are both backend-tested; the HTTP
  view wrapper itself (`DigitalFramesLibrarySendView`'s request/response
  marshaling) is still a **Gap**.

## 15. Direct upload-and-send (no library)
Card/API path: upload an image directly to a specific frame via multipart,
bypassing the library entirely (the Lovelace card's and wall picker's
upload buttons). Note: because these bytes never enter the library, the
sent photo can't be re-cropped afterwards (KPF 12's crop editors are
deliberately disabled for it).
- **Entry points**: `http_api.py` (`DigitalFramesSendImageView`,
  `resolve_frame_by_entity`), `digital-frames-card.js` (`_stageFile`/`_send`),
  `digital-frames-panel.js` (`_sendFromWallPicker`).
- **If it silently breaks**: card sends silently fail, or the wrong frame
  receives the image.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`fraimic-card.spec.js` — upload staging
  and the multipart `send_image` POST with the right `entity_id`;
  `walls-send-and-offwall.spec.js` for the wall picker side). The Python
  view itself (`DigitalFramesSendImageView`'s request/response marshaling) is
  still a **Gap** along with the rest of the `*_http.py` view layer (see
  the coverage summary below).

## 16. Scenes: named multi-frame image assignments (CRUD + send)
User builds a named "scene" (frame→image mapping) and sends every frame's
assigned image at once; exposed as `scene.*` entities for voice control.
- **Entry points**: `scenes.py` (`SceneManager.async_save_scene` /
  `async_delete_scene` / `async_send_scene` / `async_send_mappings`),
  `scene.py`, `scenes_http.py`.
- **If it silently breaks**: partial-failure semantics could be wrong (one
  dead frame blocking the whole scene, or a fully-failed scene reporting
  success).
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`walls-scenes-merge.spec.js`,
  `walls-flow.spec.js` — scene CRUD outside the Walls UI isn't directly
  covered). **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/managers/test_scenes.py`
  (CRUD, duplicate-name rejection, send_mappings partial-failure fan-out,
  schedule-disarm on delete).

## 17. Gallery art packs (curated bundles, install/sync/uninstall)
**(Content platform: Gallery tab — was "Add-ons / scene packs".)** One-click
install of a public-domain image collection into the library; optionally
auto-builds an orientation-aware scene (`create_scene=true` default).
Library-only install is supported (`create_scene=false` / panel
"Library only"). Sync repairs partial installs.
- **Entry points**: `scene_packs.py` (`ScenePackManager.async_install_pack` /
  `async_sync_pack` / `async_uninstall_pack`), `scene_packs_http.py`
  (`POST …/install` body `create_scene`), panel Gallery tab
  (`digital-frames-panel.js` `_installPack`, `_renderScenePacks`).
- **If it silently breaks**: an interrupted install leaves orphaned images
  untracked, blocking reinstall; uninstall can leave stray images if some
  deletes fail; library-only installs unexpectedly create scenes (or vice
  versa).
- **Test status**: Panel-tested indirectly (`addons-categories.spec.js`;
  `addons-catalog-refresh.spec.js` covers the catalog re-fetching on tab
  activation and panel revive rather than only once at initial load).
  **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/managers/test_scene_packs.py`
  (install success/partial-failure/all-fail, **library-only create_scene=False**,
  already-installed guard, uninstall scene+image cleanup and untag-vs-delete,
  sync recovery by filename, orientation-aware image-to-frame assignment).

## 18. Scene-pack "widgets" (agenda tool — legacy)
A pack type that downloads a Python renderer script + JSON config,
schedules it, and runs it as a subprocess to generate/send a rendered
image to one target frame. **Legacy path** — Daily Agenda still uses this
until Content Platform Phase 4 migrates it to Live generators (see
`docs/CONTENT_PLATFORM_ROADMAP.md`). Catalog no longer lists xOTD as a
widget (renderer is pinned for skills only).
- **Entry points**: `scene_packs.py` (`_async_install_widget`,
  `_schedule_widget`, `async_run_widget`); the panel's generic
  `config_schema` engine (`digital-frames-panel.js`) drives each widget's install
  form, including the `multiple` (checkbox-group, comma-joined entity ids)
  and `json` field types. Gallery **Tools** section.
- **If it silently breaks**: a widget never runs (scheduler not armed), or
  a crashed subprocess silently does nothing forever.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested for config forms only
  (`addon-config-schema.spec.js`, `addon-schema-gaps.spec.js`,
  `agenda-calendar-source.spec.js`). Backend scheduling/execution: **Gap**
  — deliberately out of scope for manager Phase 4; will be closed by Live
  Agenda migration (Content Platform Phase 4), not expanded widget tests.

## 19. Walls: virtual multi-frame layout (panel-local state)
User arranges a subset of frames on a free-form canvas mirroring how
they're physically hung; custom walls and a default "All Frames" wall are
selected via visual picker tiles, and the default wall self-syncs with
configured frames. An "Align Wall to Grid" option allows users to snap all
placed frames on a wall to a clean structured layout. When aligning selected
frames, if they would overlap each other, they are automatically spaced out
along the other axis rather than producing a collision error.
- **Entry points**: `walls.py` (`WallManager.async_save_wall`,
  `async_ensure_default_wall`, `async_prune_entry`), `walls_http.py`,
  `digital-frames-panel.js` (`_renderWallStrip`, `_openWall`, `_alignWallSelection`, `_alignWallToGrid`).
- **If it silently breaks**: removed/re-added frames haunt old layouts,
  the default wall stops tracking newly-added frames, or alignment features
  produce layout overlaps or throw unexpected error banners.
- **Test status**: Extensively panel-tested (`walls-drag.spec.js`,
  `walls-default-and-collision.spec.js`, `walls-multiselect.spec.js` — including
  alignment auto-spacing and Align Wall to Grid logic,
  `walls-flow.spec.js`, `walls-scenes-merge.spec.js`,
  `walls-send-and-offwall.spec.js`, `walls-image-picker.spec.js`,
  `walls-addon-album-lock.spec.js`) — but these exercise the frontend
  canvas/DOM logic against a mock server, not `WallManager` itself.
  **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/managers/test_walls.py` (custom wall
  CRUD, default-wall auto-sync, tombstone survival across resync, entry
  removal pruning, auto-layout collision math).

## 20. Schedules: send a scene or image at a future/recurring time
User schedules a one-shot or daily/weekly/monthly recurring send; missed
one-shots fire late on restart; a deleted scene/image target degrades a
schedule to "broken" instead of erroring at fire time.
- **Entry points**: `schedules.py` (`ScheduleManager.async_create_schedule`,
  `_arm`, `_async_fire`, `_async_fire_missed`,
  `async_handle_scene_deleted`, `next_fire_at`), `schedules_http.py`.
- **If it silently breaks**: missed schedules never fire after an outage,
  or a schedule keeps trying to fire against a deleted target forever.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`schedules.spec.js` — create/edit/toggle/
  delete, weekly validation). **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/managers/test_schedules.py` (trigger/action validation,
  missed-once fires late, recurring fire re-resolves the scene at fire
  time, target-deleted → target_missing + disabled, edit repairs a broken
  schedule, `next_fire_at` math including monthly day-of-month clamping).

## 21. HA entities: sensors + Orientation select + Camera display
Read-only device telemetry (battery/wifi/charging/firmware/IP/queued), a per-frame Orientation control that persists into config entry options, and a Camera entity representing the frame's dynamic canvas (active photo display).
- **Entry points**: `sensor.py` (all `Fraimic*Sensor` classes), `select.py`
  (`DigitalFramesOrientationSelect`), `camera.py` (`DigitalFramesCamera`).
- **If it silently breaks**: wrong/missing sensor values, selecting an orientation doesn't change rendering, or the camera entity fails to load or serve the active frame image.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/setup/test_entities.py`.

## 22. Render spec resolution (orientation lock + rotation + hanging edge)
Central "how should this image be composed for this frame" resolution —
combines native dimensions, orientation lock, 180° flips, and hang-edge
into one `RenderSpec` every send path consults.
- **Entry points**: `helpers.py` (`render_spec_for_entry`,
  `RenderSpec.variant`).
- **If it silently breaks**: this is the single riskiest piece of logic in
  the whole integration — a wrong rotation means every image sent from
  every path lands sideways or upside-down on the physical frame, and it's
  invisible until someone looks at hardware.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/unit/test_helpers_render_spec.py`.

## 23. Frame-type registry, PanelCodec ids & byte-layout dispatch
Declares every supported physical panel (resolution, **codec_id** /
byte layout, send timeout, official/community origin) and validates no
two types sharing a resolution disagree on codec. The 7.3" panel is a
second **PanelCodec** (`spectra6_sequential`) under the local Spectra
HTTP driver, not identical wire bytes to official split-half panels.
Library send/backfill and raw-upload encode go through
`panel_codec.encode_for_panel*` so codec selection is one seam.
- **Entry points**: `frame_types.py` (`FRAME_TYPES`, `codec_id`,
  `frame_type_for_resolution`, `codec_id_for_resolution`,
  `byte_layout_for_resolution`, `send_timeout_for_entry`,
  `_validate_registry`), `panel_codec.py` (`PanelCodec`, `CODECS`,
  `encode_for_panel`, `encode_for_panel_with_preview`,
  `panel_codec_for_resolution` / `_entry`).
- **If it silently breaks**: garbled image on an unregistered/misregistered
  panel size (same failure mode as image conversion, one layer up), or
  7.3" vs 13.3" packing cross-wired.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/unit/test_frame_types.py`,
  `tests/python/unit/test_panel_codec.py`.

## 24. First-run onboarding wizard + server-side completion flag
Six-step first-run tour; "skip"/"complete" retires the wizard for every
admin, forever, via a server-side flag (not localStorage).
- **Entry points**: `http_api.py` (`DigitalFramesOnboardingView`).
- **If it silently breaks**: the wizard reappears every session for every
  admin, or one admin's skip doesn't stick for others.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`onboarding.spec.js`, full six-step tour
  and skip variants). **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/setup/test_onboarding.py`
  (admin-gating + Store persistence).

## 25. Domain-level setup wiring
`async_setup` / `async_setup_entry` / `async_unload_entry` /
`async_remove_entry` — bootstraps everything above: registers HTTP views,
the sidebar panel, the Lovelace card, auto-creates the device-less
scenes-hub entry, and tears down cleanly when the last frame is removed.
- **Entry points**: `__init__.py`.
- **If it silently breaks**: this is glue — a failure here means the whole
  integration fails to load, or (subtler) removing the last frame leaves
  scene-pack/schedule timers running forever, or doesn't prune wall
  layouts.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/setup/test_init_setup_entry.py`
  (scenes-hub auto-creation, service lifecycle, wall-placement pruning on
  removal, reload on option change).

## 26. Panel init-load resilience
On open (or after an HA restart/reconnect window), the panel retries each
of its initial data loads (frames, scenes, walls, etc.) with backoff
instead of taking a single failed fetch at face value, and never infers
"nothing configured yet" from a load that errored.
- **Entry points**: `digital-frames-panel.js` (`_withInitRetry`, `_initLoadErrors`,
  `_initRetryDelays`/`_initRetriesActive`).
- **If it silently breaks**: a transient outage (HA restarting, a
  reconnect window) paints a believably-empty dashboard or wrongly opens
  the onboarding tour — Dale hit this in production before the fix (commit
  `a5b1a1b`) landed. The invariant: never make a zero-state claim from a
  load that errored; always distinguish ABSENT from UNKNOWN.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`tests/panel/init-retry.spec.js` — a
  transient outage recovers with no refresh needed, a persistent outage
  shows an "incomplete" note and never opens the tour, a broken
  onboarding-flag endpoint fails closed, a not-yet-ready websocket retries
  frame discovery, non-admins never see an admin-only error from an
  errored load). Backend: not applicable — this is frontend-only
  resilience against transient fetch failures.

## 27. Panel element lifecycle (listener/blob cleanup on disconnect)
The panel is a custom element HA recreates per navigation, not reused —
every `window`/`document` listener and every blob URL it creates (crop
editor previews, thumbnails) must be torn down on disconnect, or they leak
across every visit to the Frames panel for the life of the browser tab.
- **Entry points**: `digital-frames-panel.js` (`disconnectedCallback`, the
  `this._abort` AbortController every listener registration is tied to,
  blob URL tracking in `this._thumbUrls`).
- **If it silently breaks**: a slow memory/listener leak that only shows
  up after navigating to the panel repeatedly in one browser session —
  invisible in a quick manual check, which is exactly how it shipped once
  already (commit `71c1b17`, "Sever the panel's global listeners and blob
  URLs on disconnect").
- **Test status**: Panel-tested (`tests/panel/lifecycle.spec.js` — detach
  severs listeners and revokes blob URLs; reattach after detach revives
  correctly; a same-tick DOM move, as HA sometimes does internally, must
  NOT tear anything down). Backend: not applicable.

## 28. Live content (skills / xOTD renderer): reusable content generators
**(Content platform: Live tab — was "Daily Content / skills".)** User creates
named presets (word/quote/joke/scripture of the day, image feeds like NASA
APOD / Wikimedia POTD / Bing wallpaper, or random-from-album) and sends one
to any frame — ad hoc ("Send Now" on the Live tab, the Lovelace card's Daily
picker), staged into a scene via the wall picker, or on a schedule.
**Quick setup (Phase 3):** each Live card has frame + time + "Schedule daily"
which calls `POST /api/digital_frames/live/quick_setup` to create one daily
recurring schedule per selected frame (does not clone the skill).
Text modes render through the pinned remote `xotd_renderer.py` subprocess
at the target frame's composition size. The script writes Spectra
`xotd.bin` **and** full RGB `xotd_preview.png` (before pack).
`text_skill_payload_for_codec` then picks the wire format: Spectra frames
get the `.bin`; Meural/`jpeg_q90` gets JPEG from the **RGB PNG** (not
Spectra-unpack, so anti-aliased text is preserved). Image modes resolve to
a library image_id (feeds upload the fetched photo into the library first)
and use the normal library codec path. Previews prefer the RGB PNG so
last-image thumbnails stay sharp.
- **Entry points**: `skills.py` (`SkillManager.async_save_skill` /
  `async_render_for_entry` / `_async_render_text` /
  `_async_fetch_image_feed` / `_async_pick_image_album`),
  `panel_codec.py` (`text_skill_payload_for_codec`),
  `skills_http.py` (CRUD + `DigitalFramesSkillSendView` +
  `DigitalFramesLiveQuickSetupView`), fan-out via
  `scenes.py` (`async_send_mappings`), panel Live tab
  (`_quickScheduleLive`).
- **If it silently breaks**: daily content stops arriving (schedules
  no-op), a skill renders blank/stale content, fan-out to several frames
  shows different content per frame, Meural receives Spectra `.bin` on
  postcard (garbled/fail) instead of JPEG, quick-setup creates no/wrong
  schedules, or — the regression fixed in July 2026 — a text-skill send
  wipes the frame's last-image state so the card/panel thumbnail goes blank
  while the frame shows content.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/managers/test_skills.py` (CRUD, per-mode render dispatch,
  feed fetch/upload, subprocess lifecycle + cleanup, preview-PNG
  generation with graceful degradation, Meural JPEG re-encode from
  text-skill bin),
  `tests/python/managers/test_live_quick_setup.py` (daily schedule create,
  on_demand_only, missing skill),
  `tests/python/managers/test_scenes.py` (bin renders thread their
  preview through to the coordinator as the send thumbnail);
  `tests/python/unit/test_panel_codec.py` (`text_skill_payload_for_codec`).
  Panel-tested — `skills.spec.js` (Live tab; internal id still `xotd`),
  `walls-skill-picker.spec.js` (staging into scenes),
  `fraimic-card.spec.js` (card Daily picker send).

## 29. Lovelace card: per-frame dashboard management + last-image preview
The `fraimic-card` custom card: configured by picking a frame from a list
(entry_id; legacy battery-entity configs auto-resolve), it shows the
frame's latest displayed image — library sends via `last_image_id`,
upload/xOTD renders via the coordinator's persisted `last_thumbnail` —
and manages the frame from the dashboard: upload, library picker with
album filter, daily-skill send, orientation toggle, and crop adjustment
(KPF 12). The last-image preview state itself (mutually-exclusive
`last_image_id`/`last_thumbnail`, persisted per frame, exposed through
`/api/digital_frames/frames` and `/api/digital_frames/frame/{entry_id}/thumbnail`) is
part of this flow: every send path must leave it describing what the
frame actually shows.
- **Entry points**: `digital-frames-card.js` (card + `fraimic-card-editor`),
  `coordinator.py` (`async_set_last_image`, `last_image_id` /
  `last_thumbnail` persistence), `library_http.py` (`DigitalFramesFramesView`
  incl. `battery_entity_id`/`orientation_entity_id`/`online`,
  `DigitalFramesFrameThumbnailView`), `http_api.py` (`DigitalFramesFrameStatusView`).
- **If it silently breaks**: the card shows a stale or blank image while
  the frame shows something else (exactly what text-skill sends did
  before July 2026 — see KPF 28), the card picker falls back to raw YAML,
  or sends/orientation changes target the wrong frame.
- **Test status**: Panel-tested — `fraimic-card.spec.js` against the mock
  server + `card-harness.html` (editor frame list and entry_id config
  write, legacy entity resolution, both thumbnail sources incl. ETag'd
  render previews, upload/library/skill send round trips, orientation
  service call, crop flow). Coordinator preview persistence is
  backend-tested via `test_scenes.py`/`test_skills.py` (KPF 28); the
  frames/thumbnail HTTP views' own marshaling is still a **Gap** with the
  rest of the `*_http.py` layer.

## 30. Media Source integration
Exposes the Fraimic photo library to Home Assistant's native media source system (browsable under the Media browser and playable/resolvable via `media-source://digital_frames/...` URIs) without copying files.
- **Entry points**: `media_source.py` (`async_get_media_source`, `DigitalFramesMediaSource`).
- **If it silently breaks**: Fraimic albums and photos do not appear in the Home Assistant Media tab, or resolving a `media-source://` URI fails.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/library/test_media_source_and_tagging.py`.

## 31. AI Auto-tagging on upload & discovery
Automatically analyzes uploaded or discovered images using Home Assistant's configured multi-modal `ai_task` entity and updates image tags in `manifest.json`.
- **Entry points**: `library.py` (`LibraryManager.async_upload`, `async_discover`, `async_auto_tag_image`).
- **If it silently breaks**: Photos are uploaded or discovered but no tags are generated even when an AI Task entity is active and the option is enabled.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/library/test_media_source_and_tagging.py`.

## 32. Meural Canvas (local) as a second FramePort driver
User adds a NETGEAR Meural by LAN IP (no Meural cloud account). The frame
gets a `driver=meural` config entry, JPEG codec (`jpeg_q90`), and
participates in walls, scenes, library send, and raw upload like Fraimic
frames. Images are delivered via the local `/remote/postcard` multipart
API. Sleep-queue does not apply (send resumes the display if suspended).
Meural has no battery sensor — the dashboard and send APIs identify the
frame by its `_ip` sensor (same fallback as `battery_entity_id` on
`GET /api/digital_frames/frames`).

**Local device features (no Meural cloud):**

- **Orientation (gsensor):** identify / system report hang; Device
  orientation sensor; follow-device default for crop/send; Orientation
  select Follow / Portrait / Landscape (manual pin also calls
  `set_orientation` on the Canvas). Sends use
  `render_spec_for_hass_entry` so **live gsensor** picks portrait vs
  landscape library crops (not stale options alone). Meural composition
  is hang-sized JPEG (no Spectra native-buffer rotation). On hang change
  the Canvas firmware switches to orientation-scoped **Recents** (often
  last official-app image); we **re-postcard** the last HA library image
  (or last wire bytes) via `async_redisplay_last` so our content stays on
  screen.
- **Backlight light entity:** brightness 0–100; off = suspend, on =
  resume (+ optional brightness).
- **Ambient light (lux)** from ALS; diagnostic free space + WiFi RSSI.
- **Services:** `fraimic.sleep` → suspend, `fraimic.wake` → resume
  (Meural only). Restart is unsupported on Meural.

Text skills (xOTD) are re-encoded to JPEG for Meural via
`text_skill_payload_for_codec` (KPF 28). Image skills already used the
library JPEG path.

**Explicitly not implemented:** Meural cloud account, playlists, next/prev
artwork, shuffle, media browser, membership gallery sync.
- **Entry points**: `config_flow.py` (`async_step_add_meural`),
  `meural.py` (probe, postcard, backlight/suspend/resume/orientation
  helpers),
  `meural_coordinator.py` (poll stats, command map, follow-device),
  `light.py` (`MeuralBacklightLight`),
  `sensor.py` (device orientation, ambient light, free space, WiFi),
  `select.py` (`MeuralOrientationSelect`),
  `panel_codec.py` (`CODEC_JPEG_Q90`),
  `__init__.py` (driver branch, wake service),
  `library_http.py` frames list,
  `digital-frames-panel.js` (`_discoverFrames` battery-or-`_ip`).
- **If it silently breaks**: Meural cannot be added, sends fail or send
  Spectra `.bin`, frame missing on dashboard, crop aspect wrong after
  rotate, backlight/sleep services no-op or hit Fraimic `/api/*` paths
  on the Canvas, lux/backlight stuck after firmware field renames.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** —
  `tests/python/unit/test_meural.py` (JPEG, orientation, follow-device,
  system stats parse, suspend/backlight command mapping),
  `tests/python/config_flow/test_config_flow_user_scan.py` (Meural add).
  **Frontend-tested** — `tests/panel/meural-dashboard.spec.js`. Live
  Canvas hardware is manual (**Gap** for CI).

## 34. Samsung EM32DX local MDC driver (experimental)
User adds a Samsung E-Paper (EM32DX-class) panel by LAN IP, MDC PIN, and
optional Wi‑Fi MAC. Images are composed as PNG and delivered by staging a
short-lived token URL under HA’s HTTP, then sending MDC content-download
(0xC7) over TLS :1515 so the panel pulls the PNG — protocol from
[fayep/Joyous](https://github.com/fayep/Joyous). No Samsung cloud. **Not
validated on real hardware in this repo** (Gap: live panel).
- **Entry points**: `config_flow.py` (`async_step_add_samsung`),
  `samsung.py` (`mdc_content_download_packet`, `send_mdc_content_download`,
  `send_wol`), `samsung_coordinator.py` (`SamsungCoordinator`),
  `panel_codec.py` (`CODEC_PNG`), `http_api.py`
  (`DigitalFramesSamsungContentView`), `sensor.py` (IP + MDC reachable).
- **If it silently breaks**: send fails (auth/PIN, URL >255 bytes, panel
  asleep without Network Standby/WoL), or panel never fetches the token
  URL (HA not reachable from the panel LAN).
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/unit/test_samsung.py`
  (packet build, WoL, mock MDC). Live hardware is manual (**Gap**).

## 33. Check for updates from the dashboard Settings modal
Admin opens ⚙ Settings on the Fraimic panel and sees **on-disk** package
version vs latest GitHub release (and, when different, the version HA is
still **running** in memory). Can **Check for updates**, **Install**
(HACS `async_download_repository` when the repo is already installed via
HACS; else GitHub zipball into `custom_components/digital_frames` **plus** a
HACS bookkeeping sync so `installed_version` / the HA update entity match
disk), then **Restart Home Assistant**. After install, status shows disk
vs running and forces the Restart control until they match — HA's loader
cache is not the install source of truth. Opening Settings / checking for
updates also **auto-heals** a HACS `installed_version` that still lags
disk (legacy zipball-only installs) — no user re-sync step.

When a newer release is available and not dismissed for that version,
admins also see a **dashboard banner** (Install + Dismiss). Dismiss is
server-side and per-version (`POST /api/digital_frames/update/dismiss`) so a
later release re-shows the banner; GitHub checks are TTL-cached so the
banner does not hammer the API on every panel open.
- **Entry points**: `update.py` (`get_disk_version`, `get_running_version`,
  `check_for_update`, `install_update`, `dismiss_update_banner`,
  `banner_visible`, `_try_hacs_install`, `_sync_hacs_after_install`,
  `restart_home_assistant`),
  `update_http.py` (`/api/digital_frames/update*`),
  `digital-frames-panel.js` (`_refreshUpdateBanner`, `_renderUpdateBanner`,
  `_dismissUpdateBanner`, `_refreshUpdateStatus`,
  `_installIntegrationUpdate`, `_restartHomeAssistant`).
- **If it silently breaks**: settings claim "up to date" while disk is
  newer than HA's loaded module (or the reverse), install succeeds but UI
  never prompts restart, install updates files but HACS/HA still show the
  old version after restart, the banner never appears (or won't dismiss /
  reappears for the same version after dismiss), users still need HACS +
  System restart, or a botched install leaves a half-written
  `custom_components/digital_frames`.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/unit/test_update.py`
  (version compare, disk vs running / needs_restart, HACS sync after
  zipball, auto-heal on check, modern HACS download path, banner_visible
  dismiss rules). **Panel-tested** — `tests/panel/update-banner.spec.js`
  (show / hide / dismiss / non-admin). Live GitHub check/install is
  admin-manual (**Gap** for CI; network + filesystem).

## 34. Product branding + domain as Digital Frames
Product and technical identity are **Digital Frames** /
`digital_frames`: HACS name, manifest domain, package
`custom_components/digital_frames/`, sidebar panel URL `/digital_frames`,
services `digital_frames.*`, HTTP `/api/digital_frames/*`, media source
`media-source://digital_frames/…`. Official Spectra hardware still uses
manufacturer **Fraimic** and driver id `fraimic`.

**Albums / library survive the domain rename:** on first load the local
library is renamed `config/fraimic_library/` →
`config/digital_frames_library/` (manifest + originals + album tags).
Dropbox does the same for `/fraimic_library` → `/digital_frames_library`
when possible; Google Drive reuses an existing "Fraimic Library" folder
if present. Library settings migrate
`.storage/fraimic_library_settings` → `digital_frames_library_settings`.
Config entries, walls, scenes, and schedules under the old domain are
**not** migrated — re-add frames after upgrade.

**Panel URL:** primary sidebar path is `/digital_frames`. Setup also
registers a **legacy alias** at `/fraimic` (no second sidebar entry) so
old bookmarks keep working, and logs a warning if leftover
`custom_components/fraimic/` is still present (must be removed).
- **Entry points**: `const.py` (`DOMAIN`, `PRODUCT_NAME`, `LIBRARY_DIRNAME`,
  `LEGACY_DOMAIN`), `manifest.json` / `hacs.json`, `__init__.py` (panel
  path + legacy `/fraimic` alias + leftover-folder warning),
  `library.py` (`async_load` settings migrate), all `*_http.py` view URLs,
  `digital-frames-panel.js` / `digital-frames-card.js`.
- **If it silently breaks**: leftover `custom_components/fraimic/` still
  owns `/fraimic` with old code; users only installed the package under
  the old path; library path renames orphan albums.
- **Test status**: **Backend-tested** — `tests/python/unit/test_branding.py`
  (domain, product name, stable `LIBRARY_DIRNAME`). Full entry migration
  is intentionally out of scope.
