# Test ledger

Append-only, durable record of test-suite runs against `main`. CI appends
one row per suite per push (see the "Record result in the test ledger"
step in `.github/workflows/python-tests.yaml` and `panel-tests.yaml`);
rows are committed back to this file with `[skip ci]`, so recording never
triggers more CI. Failures are recorded too — a red row is the point of
having a ledger.

Notes on reading it:
- Both test workflows are path-filtered, so a push that touches neither
  the backend nor the frontend (docs, CI) legitimately has no row.
- `Coverage` is the backend suite's overall `custom_components.fraimic`
  percentage; the Playwright suite doesn't measure coverage.
- Rows marked `local` were recorded by hand before CI recording existed
  (or for suites run outside CI); everything after 2026-07-12 should come
  from CI.
