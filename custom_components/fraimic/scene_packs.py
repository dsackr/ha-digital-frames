"""Scene packs: curated bundles of public-domain images plus an
auto-assembled scene.

Content (a manifest and its source images) lives in this same repo under
scene_packs/ and is fetched at install time from GitHub raw content -- see
SCENE_PACK_INDEX_URL in const.py. Installing a pack downloads its images
through the same LibraryManager.async_upload() pipeline a manual upload
uses, so images end up wherever the user's library is already configured to
live (Local/Dropbox/Google Drive) and get the normal per-resolution .bin
conversion -- packs never ship pre-baked .bin files, since those are keyed
to each user's specific frame resolutions and byte layout (see
image_converter.py) and would go stale the moment a new panel size ships.

Installing also auto-builds a ready-to-send Scene by assigning each
downloaded image to one of the user's configured frames, matching frame
orientation to image orientation where possible -- no manual mapping step
required.
