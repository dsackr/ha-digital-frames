# exact CLI contract (--render-only, --config <path>, writing xotd.bin next
# to it) for its per-render subprocess isolation -- an unrelated frame-addons
# change to main that altered or dropped those flags would otherwise break
# every skill render for every installed user, with no coordinated rollout.

# (frame-reported) dimensions. "auto" is the Fraimic way: any picture goes to
# any frame, mismatched-orientation images are displayed sideways at full
# size. "portrait"/"landscape" lock the frame: mismatched images are
# auto-cropped (centered cover) to stay upright instead.
