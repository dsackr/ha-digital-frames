"""xOTD (Day-of-the-Day) Renderer & Frame Uploader.

Fetches a daily joke, quote, or Bible verse -- depending on the configured
content_mode -- from the web or a local custom list, renders it onto a
premium high-contrast canvas, encodes it to the Spectra 6 4-bit binary
format, and uploads it to the Fraimic e-ink canvas frame. content_mode
"message" instead renders a user-typed message_text in one of a handful of
fixed visual styles -- no fetch involved, the text comes straight from the
caller's config.json.
