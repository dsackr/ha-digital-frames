"""Walls: a virtual layout of a subset of the user's frames, positioned the
way they're physically hung (e.g. 4 frames on the living room wall).

A wall only stores where each frame sits on a free-form canvas -- it never
stores which images are assigned. Loading a scene onto a wall and saving the
result back is entirely a panel-side operation against the existing scenes
API; walls themselves are pure layout state, never referenced by
automations, voice control, or any entity platform.
