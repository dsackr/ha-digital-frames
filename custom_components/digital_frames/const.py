# change to main that altered or dropped those flags would otherwise break

# (frame-reported) dimensions. "auto" is the Fraimic way: any picture goes to
# any frame, mismatched-orientation images are displayed sideways at full
# size. "portrait"/"landscape" lock the frame: mismatched images are
# auto-cropped (centered cover) to stay upright instead.
