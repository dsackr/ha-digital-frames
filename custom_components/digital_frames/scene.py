"""Scene platform for the Fraimic integration.

Hosted on the auto-created "scenes hub" config entry (see
const.KIND_SCENES_HUB and __init__.py) rather than any single frame's entry,
since scenes are domain-level state shared across every frame -- forwarding
this platform from a frame's own entry would register the same scene
unique_ids from every frame, and deleting whichever frame happened to win
entity ownership would silently drop every scene entity.

Exposing scenes as real scene.* entities (instead of only the fraim.send_scene
service) is what lets Alexa/Google Assistant/Assist activate them by name --
HA's voice integrations act on entities, not arbitrary services.
